# Basic-Slime-Simulation
Basic slime simulation in unity, based off of Sebastian Lague's youtube video, and my first experience with using compute shaders.

Its not the cleanest code since the purpose of this project was to help me learn how to use compute shaders, but it does incorporate some of the basic functionality.
